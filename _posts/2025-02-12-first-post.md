This is my first ever post! I am creating this on day 3 or 4 of my Electronic Textiles class (I have already lost count). Welcome to my website. Please enjoy.

You may be wondering about the cat motif. I have nothing to say about it. Sorry.

I am exceptionally bad at anything with numbers, and so far this class has featured few to none. I may have faith in myself. (Famous last words.)

I'm going to try to publish this now. I hope everything works. Wish me luck!
