Hello! I'm Grey Ballarini and I am an Art History and English major (class of '29) building a website for my computer science class.

I do not have any programming experience, but I do have some sewing experience. I'd definitely like to improve on both of these fronts. I also aim to build my crochet skills as a form of textile in this class, as it's been a long time since I've crocheted consistently. 

Generally speaking, I have already fulfilled one of my goals (learning literally anything about coding), and I aim to grow my skills as much as possible in this class. And maybe end up a little less scared of computers. So far I've been struggling with adding images, but I think I've finally gotten the hang of it.

A boring fact about me is that I am from Phoenix (this may be less boring at Williams where almost no one is from Arizona).

Thank you for reading! I hope you enjoy witnessing the rest of my journey into computer science.
